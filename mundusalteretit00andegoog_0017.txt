DrogiuS. They discuss the advantages of foreign travel,
a subject which Hall has treated also in an independent
work ‘ Quo vadis ἰ’-Α just censure of travel, as it is
undertaken by the gentlemen of our nation ⁹. BeroalduS,
who has already ¹travelled far and seen many lands,
expresses contempt of so·called travel. For, he says,

finally he overcomes all their scruples by a triumphant
appeal to their love of adventure. All this breathes
the very spirit of the time. We are still in the spacious
days of Elizabeth; men felt that fresh lands awaited
