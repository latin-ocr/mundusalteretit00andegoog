BELL’S LATIN COURSE

FOR THE FIRST YEAR.
ΒΥ E. c, MARCHANT, M.A.‚ Am> J. G. SPENCER, BLA.

HIS Course is written on the lines recommended by the Classical

Association, and adopted by the Board of Education. The commonly
used grammar only is taught (rare usages excluded); all grammar is taught
gradually as the exercises proceed; and the exercises are made interesting.
In one point the editors claim to have gone further than the recommendationis: -
viz. in the English into Latin exerciseS. These are consecutive and make
sense, and they exemplify the rules being taught. Moreover the English into
Latin corresponds with the Latin into English—a valuable innovation, as it
helps to fix the vocabulary and the rules, and to correlate all the knowledge.

BELL’S CONCISE LATIN COURSE

PART 1.
ΒΥ Ε. C. MARCHANT, M.A.‚ ΑΜ) J. G. SPENCER, Β.Α.

HIS volume is not merely an abbreviated version of the Editors' well-known

Latin Course in three parts. The whole of the matter has been thoroughly
revised, and all the necessary grammar is given at the beginning. Many
sentences have been discarded‚ especially stom the first part, so that the
progress in grammar is more rapid, but the special features of the Latin Course
remain as they were.

this part the method is based not, 'as before, on the ordinary aeacidem, bnt on
the ordinary syntax. A few points os accidence—such as the harder numerals,
the so· called imperative future, the gerunds and snpine-are now mentioned>
and used for the first time.
