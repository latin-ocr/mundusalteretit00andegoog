PREFACE

Some ten years ago this book could scarcely have
hoped for a welcome. In the meantime matters have
moved rapidly. Science is insisting more strongly on
her claims, and‘ the old type of classical training is
doomed to disappear. This is not a missortune, but a
blessing in disguise. We have thrown aside much that
was merely the debris of pedantry. The old Latin
grammar, with its masses of rules and exceptions, has
practically vanished; and no one will regret its dis·
appearance. So we are able to approach the literature
almost at once, and teachers are casting about in
every direction sor easy and pleasant reading, with
which to introduce their pupils to the language.

Recently the Scotch Education Department called
attention to the dearth of such material, and suggested

that portions even of the Vulgate might be read in the
earliest stages We believe that the present book will
be os value in the movement. It is not meant for the
very earliest stage of reading, but rather sor the awk-
ward period which immediately precedes the reading of
· difficult authors. That Caesar at least is unsuitable at
this stage we are convinced3 he is too impersonal to
be interesting, unless he can be read rapidly. Much
less can a boy be expected so soon to appreciate the
perfect form of Livy or Horace ; he must first feel at
home in the language.
