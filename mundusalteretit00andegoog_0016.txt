describes and justifies the course which he took. So
it was that the book appeared not in Hall’s own name,

but under the pseudonym ‘ Mercurius Britannicus ⁸.
It was often reprinted in the century which saw its

production, and later 3 and there is an interesting
tradition, which may well be true, that Swift himself

took some hints from its pages for the travels of the

though all were inadequate. One was made by the
scholar John Healy during the author’s lifetime. Of his
version (there is a copy in the Bodleian Library at
Oxford) it is said that it ‘is not destitute of talent and

dominions of Prince de l’Amour not hitherto found

first book by Dr. William King (born 1663), a lawyer
with a turn for humorous writing, will be found in the
volume of Ideal Commonwealths in Morley’s Universal
Library. For a long time this fragment was supposed
to be original. A Mr. Pratt, who first published a eom-

dating, that he eventually abandoned the design ’.
